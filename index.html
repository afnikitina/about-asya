		<h1>This is a page about Asya</h1>
		<p>Hi there! My name is Asya. I am originally from <strong>Moscow, Russia</strong>. I had worked most of my life as a chemist. At some point I decided that I loved software development better and... here I am!</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, I don't have any picture of me, so I am putting a picture of my dog, Toby, here instead. Isn't he cute!.</p>

			<p>The reason I don't have an image of myself handy is that I don't do social media. But I guess, it has to be changed from now on. I need to create a couple of social media accounts in order to meet this bootcamp requirements.</p>
			<p>It freaks me out a little bit, to be honest.<span><i class="far fa-flushed"></i></span></p>

				<li>I love playing with Toby but he is afraid of fireworks!</li>
				<li>I live in Sandia Foothills and I love hiking there.</li>
