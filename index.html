		<H1>This is a page (sort of) about Asya</H1>
		<p>Hi there! My name is Asya. I am originally from Moscow, Russia. I had worked most of my life as a chemist. At some point I decided that I loved software development better and... here I am!</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, I don't have any picture of me, so I am putting a random image here.</p>

			<p>The reason I don't have an image of myself handy is that I don't do social media. But I guess, it has to be changed from now on. I need to create a couple of social media accounts in order to meet this bootcamp requirements.</p>
			<p>It freaks me out a little bit, to be honest.<span id="smiley-face">&#9786;</span></p>
			<ul><span id="list">Some fun facts about me:</span>
				<li>I have a dog named Toby. He is afraid of fireworks!</li>
				<li>I live in Sandia Foothills and I love hiking there.</li>
